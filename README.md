This project is a Netflix homepage clone developed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. It replicates the look and feel of Netflix's user interface, showcasing modern web layout techniques and responsive design elements.
Objective:
The main goal of this project was to recreate the visual and structural elements of the Netflix home screen to improve front-end development skills, especially in layout design, media presentation, and user interface styling
Key Features:
Hero Section: A large banner area highlighting a featured show (e.g., Money Heist) with title, description, and buttons ("Play", "My List").
Scrollable Thumbnails: Rows of movie/show thumbnails organized by category such as "Netflix" and "Trending".
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes using CSS flexbox/grid.
Image Overlay Effects (optional): Hover interactions (if implemented) to simulate a dynamic user experience similar to the original Netflix platform.
Custom Fonts and Colors: Netflix-style branding with dark theme, bold typography, and high-contrast visuals.
